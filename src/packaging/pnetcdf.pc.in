# Name: A human-readable name for the library or package. This does not
#      affect usage of the pkg-config tool, which uses the name of the .pc file.
# Description: A brief description of the package.
# URL: An URL where people can get more information about and download the
#      package.
# Version: A string specifically defining the version of the
#	package.
# Requires: A list of packages required by this package. The versions of these
#           packages may be specified using the comparison operators =, <, >,
#           <= or >=.
# Requires.private: A list of private packages required by this package but not
#                   exposed to applications. The version specific rules from
#                   the Requires field also apply here.
# Conflicts: An optional field describing packages that this one conflicts
#            with. The version specific rules from the Requires field also
#            apply here. This field also takes multiple instances of the same
#            package. E.g., Conflicts: bar < 1.2.3, bar >= 1.3.0.
# Cflags: The compiler flags specific to this package and any required
#         libraries that don't support pkg-config. If the required libraries
#         support pkg-config, they should be added to Requires or
#         Requires.private.
# Libs: The link flags specific to this package and any required libraries that
#       don't support pkg-config. The same rule as Cflags applies here.
# Libs.private: The link flags for private libraries required by this package
#               but not exposed to applications. The same rule as Cflags
#               applies here.
