Parallel netCDF (PnetCDF) is a library providing high-performance parallel I/O
while still maintaining file-format compatibility with Unidata's NetCDF,
specifically the classic CDF 1, 2, and 5 formats. Although NetCDF supports
parallel I/O starting from version 4, it is built on top of HDF5 and thus its
parallel feature requires files in HDF5 format. PnetCDF is currently the only
option for parallel I/O on files in classic formats.  

Starting from version 1.1.0, PnetCDF supports the CDF-5 file format, an
extension of CDF-2, that supports more atomic data types and allows users to
define large dimensions, attributes, and variables (>2B array elements).

NetCDF gives scientific programmers a space-efficient and portable means for
storing data.  By making some small changes to the NetCDF APIs, PnetCDF can use
MPI-IO to achieve high-performance parallel I/O.

More extensive installation guides can be found in file INSTALL.  Additional
information regarding the contents of the release can be found in the
RELEASE_NOTES file in the top-level directory.  Finally, the PnetCDF web
sites:
    http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/parallel-netcdf
    http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/projects/PnetCDF
contain information on bug fixes and software releases.


Requirements:

    - PnetCDF relies on MPI-IO.  ROMIO, the most common MPI-IO implementation,
      can make use of a prefix in front of the file name to specify the
      underlying file system and override ROMIO's auto detection. A typical
      prefix would look like "nfs:" or "pvfs2:".  Bear this in mind if you use
      a file name with ':' characters.  In some cases, ROMIO might think you
      are passing in a prefix and will complain about an unsupported file
      system type.  If that happens, add a file-system prefix to your file
      name.   
      
    - To build parallel-netcdf, you will need the following additional programs:
        - autotools (autoconfig, automake, libtool, m4, etc.)
        - Optional: (for PnetCDF developers)
             - either yacc or bison
	     - either lex or flex
      These are usually part of your operating system's development tools.


Build recipes:
    The process of building and installation of PnetCDF library is usually
    simple: by just running commands "./configure" and "make install". Several
    configure options are also available to customize it.

    Several machine- and compiler-specific build recipes are available under
    the directory of doc.
    - README.IBM        (BlueGene systems)
    - README.SX         (NEC SX systems)
    - README.CRAY       (Cray systems)
    - README.INTEL      (Intel Compilers)
    - README.LINUX      (GNU compilers)
    - README.Fujitsu    (Fujitsu systems)
    - README.K-Computer (the K computer @RIKEN)
    - README.SGI        (SGI systems, such as Endeavour @NASA)


Note on supporting large files and large variables.

    - Some Fortran APIs contain arguments of 64-bit integer data type, which
      corresponds to MPI_Offset data type in their peer C APIs. Declare those
      arguments as 'integer(kind=MPI_OFFSET_KIND)'.

    - In places where you might use NF_UNLIMITED to define an unlimited 
      dimension in one of the nfmpi_ routines, use NFMPI_UNLIMITED. 
      NFMPI_UNLIMITED has been defined as the proper 64-bit integer type for
      nfmpi_def_dim, whereas NF_UNLIMITED might be too small. Similarly, for
      Fortran 90, use NF90MPI_UNLIMITED instead of NF90_UNLIMITED.


Mailing List

    PnetCDF user community discusses the design and use of the library on the
    parallel-netcdf@mcs.anl.gov mailing list. Anyone interested in developing
    or using PnetCDF is encouraged to join. Visit the list information page
