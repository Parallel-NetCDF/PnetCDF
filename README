PnetCDF (Parallel netCDF) is a high-performance parallel I/O library for
accessing the classic Unidata's NetCDF files, specifically the CDF 1, 2, and 5
formats. Although NetCDF supports parallel I/O starting from version 4, it is
built on top of HDF5 and thus its parallel feature requires files in HDF5
format. PnetCDF is currently the only option for performing parallel I/O on
files in classic formats.

Starting from version 1.1.0, PnetCDF supports the CDF-5 file format, an
extension of CDF-2, that supports more atomic data types and allows users to
define large dimensions, attributes, and variables (>2B array elements).

NetCDF gives scientific programmers a space-efficient and portable means for
storing data. By making some small changes to the NetCDF APIs, PnetCDF can use
MPI-IO to achieve high-performance parallel I/O.

More extensive installation guides can be found in file INSTALL. Additional
information regarding the contents of the release can be found in the
RELEASE_NOTES file in the top-level directory. Finally, the PnetCDF project
web sites below contain information on bug fixes and software releases.

Requirements:
    - PnetCDF relies on MPI-IO.  ROMIO, the most common MPI-IO implementation,
      can make use of a prefix in front of the file name to specify the
      underlying file system and override ROMIO's auto detection. A typical
      prefix would look like "nfs:" or "pvfs2:".  Bear this in mind if you use
      a file name with ':' characters.  In some cases, ROMIO might think you
      are passing in a prefix and will complain about an unsupported file
      system type.  If that happens, add a file-system prefix to your file
      name.
    - To build PnetCDF, you will need the following additional programs:
        - autotools (autoconfig, automake, libtool, m4, etc.)
        - Optional: (for PnetCDF developers)
             - either yacc or bison
	     - either lex or flex
      These are usually part of your operating system's development tools.


Build recipes:
    The process of building and installation of PnetCDF library is usually
    simple: by just running commands "./configure", "make", and "make install".
    (If more than one set of MPI compilers are available on your system, adding
    option --with-mpi=/path/to/MPI/install to the configure command line is
    recommended.) Several configure options are also available to customize it.
    See INSTALL for more information.

    Several machine- and compiler-specific build recipes are available under
    the directory of doc.

Note on supporting large files and large variables.
    - Some Fortran APIs contain arguments of 64-bit integer data type, which
      corresponds to MPI_Offset data type in their peer C APIs. Declare those
      arguments as 'integer(kind=MPI_OFFSET_KIND)'.

    - In places where you might use NF_UNLIMITED to define an unlimited
      dimension in one of the nfmpi_ routines, use NFMPI_UNLIMITED.
      NFMPI_UNLIMITED has been defined as the proper 64-bit integer type for
      nfmpi_def_dim, whereas NF_UNLIMITED might be too small. Similarly, for
      Fortran 90, use NF90MPI_UNLIMITED instead of NF90_UNLIMITED.
