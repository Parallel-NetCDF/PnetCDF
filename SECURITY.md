# Security Policy

Security issues specific to the PnetCDF code base itself have so far been rare.
The issue label, `security` is used to identify issues which manifest known
security vulnerabilities.

Security issues, when discovered, follow the same process as any other bug
fixes.  Security issues are triaged and assessed for severity and likelihood.
Work to correct security issues is then scheduled as appropriate.

Though the project has so far not encountered urgent security vulnerabilities,
should any arise the project will use GitHub's security communication
mechanisms to gather information.

In the event the PnetCDF user community requires notification of a potential
urgent security vulnerability, our intention is to provide an update on or
about the same time we use our normal communication mechanisms to alert users.

## Supported Versions

The supported version of PnetCDF is the *latest* release.
All releases of PnetCDF can be found on the
[download page](https://parallel-netcdf.github.io/wiki/Download.html).

Any security issues requiring immediate updates to PnetCDF will be made
available, at best, only in the *latest* release but might also only be made
available in the *next* planned release.  A planned release of PnetCDF may be
accelerated in order to address a security issue.  On very rare occasions, the
PnetCDF project may re-release an already released version solely to address a
specific or severe issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Generally, any issues with security implications should be submitted through
the project's [GitHub security](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/security)
