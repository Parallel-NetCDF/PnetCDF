This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* New features
  + NetCDF-4 driver -- Accessing HDF5-based NetCDF-4 files is now supported.
    PnetCDF can be built on top of NetCDF-4, which allows PnetCDF to read and
    write a NetCDF-4 file. However, the burst buffering currently do not
    support NetCDF-4 file formats.
  + Thread-safe capability is added to this release. It can be enabled by
    command-line option `--enable-thread-safe` at configure time. In addition,
    option `--with-pthread` can be used to specify the path to the pthreads
    library. This feature currently only supports one-thread-per-file I/O
    operation.

* New optimization
  + The internal data buffering mechanism in the burst buffer driver is
    removed. This mechanism caches the request data in memory until the
    accumulated size is more than 8 MiB, so the write requests to burst buffers
    can be aligned with 8 MiB boundaries. However, experiments on Cray DataWarp
    show a negligible performance improvement unless the I/O request is small
    and fragment. On the other hand, it can degrade performance for mid- and
    large-sized requests. The burst buffer driver now writes directly to the
    burst buffers for each user write request.

* New Limitations
  + Due to a bug in HDF5 1.10.2 that fails zero-length write requests to record
    variables in the collective mode, PnetCDF is not able to support such
    requests when NetCDF-4 feature is enabled. New HDF5 releases are expected
    to contain the fix.

* Update configure options
  + Enable NetCDF-4 support.
    - `--enable-netcdf4`: enable NetCDF4 format classic mode support
    - `--with-hdf5=/path/to/hdf5`: set HDF5 install path
    - `--with-netcdf4=/path/to/netcdf-4`: set NetCDF install path

* Bug fixes
  + For put and get APIs when buftype is MPI_DATATYPE_NULL, bufcount is
    ignored. This is not implemented correctly for blocking put and get APIs.
    See bug fix committed on Aug. 25, 2018.
  + ncmpidiff -- when comparing two files that contain record variables but
    no record has been written. See bug fix committed on Aug. 25, 2018.
  + ncmpidiff -- when comparing two scalar variables, error NC_EBADDIM may
    mistakenly reported. See bug fix committed on Aug. 12, 2018.

* New example programs
  + examples/C/pthread.c - demonstrates the one-file-per-thread I/O example.
    When running on some parallel machines, users may need to set certain
    environment variable to enable MPI multi-threading support, for example on
    Cori @NERSC with command
    ```
    export MPICH_MAX_THREAD_SAFETY=multiple
    ```

* New programs for I/O benchmarks
  + none

* New test program
  + test/testcases/error_precedence.m4 - tests the error code reporting
    precedence
  + test/nc4/put_get_all_kinds.m4 - tests all supported variable read/write
    API. Make sure they are properly wired up
  + test/nc4/interoperability_rd.m4 - tests whether NetCDF-4 file written using
    NetCDF can be read by PnetCDF
  + test/nc4/interoperability_wr.m4 - tests whether NetCDF-4 file written using
    PnetCDF can be read by NetCDF
  + test/nc4/simple_xy.c - tests reading NetCDF-4 files, borrowed the test
    program simple_xy.c from NetCDF
  + test/testcases/tst_pthread.c - tests thread-safe capability for scenario of
    each thread operating on a unique file.

* Conformity with NetCDF library
  + In contract to NetCDF-4 which allows to read/write variables in define mode
    when the file format is in NetCDF-4 format, PnetCDF still requires reading
    and writing variables in data mode.

* Discrepancy from NetCDF library
  + In contrast to nc_set_fill() in NetCDF, ncmpi_set_fill() changes the fill
    mode of all variables newly defined in the current scope of defined mode.
    Variables affected include the ones created before and after the call to
    ncmpi_set_fill(). Note this API has no effect on the existing variables
    defined in the previous define mode. This behavior follows the convention
    adopted by NetCDF-3, but not NetCDF-4. To change fill mode for individual
    variables after the call to ncmpi_set_fill(), API ncmpi_def_var_fill() can
    be used for this purpose. Reference of NetCDF 4.1.3 user guide for
    (nc_set_fill())[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/documentation/historic/netcdf-c/nc_005fset_005ffill.html]
  + The error code precedence can be different between NetCDF and PnetCDF.
