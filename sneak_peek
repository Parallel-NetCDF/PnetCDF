------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * Thread-safe capability is added to this release. It can be enabled with
      configure option --enable-thread-safe. In addition, option --with-pthread
      can be used to specify the path to the pthreads library. This feature
      currently only supports one-thread-per-file I/O operation.

  o New optimization
    * The internal data buffering mechanism in the burst buffer driver is
      removed. This mechanism caches the request data in memory until the
      accumulated size is more than 8 MiB, so the write requests to burst
      buffers can be aligned with 8 MiB boundaries. However, experiments on
      Cray DataWarp show a negligible performance improvement unless the I/O
      request is small and fragment. On the other hand, it can degrade
      performance for mid- and large-sized requests. The burst buffer driver
      now writes directly to the burst buffers for each user write request.

  o Other updates:
    * none

  o Bug fixes
    * none

  o New example programs
    * examples/C/pthread.c - demonstrates the one-file-per-thread I/O example.
      When running on some parallel machines, users may need to set certain
      environment variable to enable MPI multi-threading support, for example
      on Cori @NERSC with command "export MPICH_MAX_THREAD_SAFETY=multiple".

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/testcases/tst_pthread.c - tests thread-safe capability for scenario
      of each thread operating on a unique file.

  o Conformity with NetCDF library
    * none

  o New conflict with NetCDF library
    * none

  o New issues related to MPI library vendors:
    * none

  o New issues related to Darshan library:
    * none

  o New clarifications
    * none
