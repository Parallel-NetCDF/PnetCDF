This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * none

  o New optimization
    * Internal memory management for nonblocking APIs has been improved further
      to reduce memory footprint. See r3763.
    * Both blocking and nonblocking varn APIs have been improved for better
      performance and reduced memory footprint. See r3747-r3750.
    * Prior to this release, when buftype in flexible APIs indicates a
      noncontiguous layout in user buffer, PnetCDF packs the user buffer into
      a contiguous buffer allocated internally, which will later be used in
      MPI-IO calls. To reduce memory footprint, this release avoids the
      additional memory allocation and directly uses the user buffer in MPI-IO
      calls when byte-swap and type-conversion are not required. See r3722 and
      r3723.

  o New Limitations
    * none

  o Update configure options
    * Option in-place byte-swap is expanded into the followings.
      --enable-in-place-swap : perform byte swap on user I/O buffers whenever
      possible. This option results in the least amount of internal memory
      usage. However, if an immutable user buffer is used, segmentation fault
      may occur when byte swap is performed on user buffer in place.
      --disable-in-place-swap : when byte swap is required, an internal memory
      space will be allocated for byte swap without altering the contents of
      user buffer. This option will increase internal memory footprint.
      default (neither the above option is used at the command line): an
      internal buffer is allocated for byte swap only when the I/O request size
      is less than 4 KiB. For larger requests, user buffers are used for
      in-place byte swap.
      The mode can also be changed at the run time by setting the PnetCDF hint
      nc_in_place_swap. See New hints below for more info.
      Note -in-place-swap option only affect applications running on Little
      Endian machines, as no byte swap is necessary on Big Endian machines.

  o New constants
    * none

  o New APIs
    * none

  o API syntax changes
    * none

  o API semantics updates
    * ncmpi_put_vard and ncmpi_get_vard APIs
      1. Now allow to write and read two or more variables in a single call to
         vard APIs. In this case, argument varid will be the ID of first
         variable. Argument filetype should be constructed by using the
         relative distance between any two successive variables. See example
         program examples/C/vard_mvars.c.
      2. When argument filetype is MPI_DATATYPE_NULL, the request is considered
         a zero-length request.
      3. Limitation of vard APIs: The element data type of filetype must
         conform with the variable external NC data type. The element data
         types of all variables accessed in filetype must be the same.
         Otherwise, NC_EMULTITYPES will be returned.
      4. buftype must contain only one element data type. Otherwise
         NC_EMULTITYPES will be returned.

  o New error code precedence
    * none

  o Updated error strings
    * none

  o New error code
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * nc_in_place_swap -- to enable or disable in-place byte swap on Little
      Endian architectures. The default mode is auto. See in-place byte-swap
      option above for descriptions of the three modes. Below is an example
      that changes the mode set at the configure time to "enable", by setting
      the environment variable PNETCDF_HINTS with command:
          export PNETCDF_HINTS="nc_in_place_swap=enable"

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o Build recipe
    * doc/README.Ubuntu is revised and the fix of adding LDFLAGS is no longer
      necessary.

  o New/updated utility program
    * ncvalidator adds a new option -t to turn on tracing mode which prints all
      successfully validated metadata till the first error encountered.
    * ncvalidator adds a check to detect whether there are two or more
      unlimited dimensions defined in the file and, if yes, reports error code
      NC_EUNLIMIT.

  o Other updates:
    * Inter-library dependencies among C, C++ and Fortran have been updated to
      follow automake user guide: add FLIBS and FCLIBS to _LIBADD.
    * Add a check for NC_EUNLIMIT in API ncmpi_open to detect whether two or
      more unlimited dimensions are defined in a corrupted file.

  o Bug fixes
    * Fix configure-time bug that configure fails to recognize the compilers
      with full path names set in the environment variable MPICC, MPICXX,
      MPIF77, or MPI_F90. See Ticket #35 for bug report and r3740 for fix.
    * Fix the bug that writing scalar attributes of type NF_INT64 was
      mistakenly casted to NF_INT. See r3730.
    * Fix the calculation of new record number in put_vard API. Thanks to
      Jim Edwards. See r3675.
    * Fix the calculation of growing size of nonblocking request queues to
      include the number of records of a record variable, as such request is
      split into multiple additional requests, one for each record. See r3651.
    * Remove freeing name object because NC_ENULLPAD is not a fatal error. See
      r3644. This bug only appears when --enable-null-byte-header-padding is
      set at configure time and opening files whose headers are not padded with
      null bytes.
    * Member "value" of NC_dimarray, NC_attrarray, and NC_vararray can still be
      NULL when a corrupted tag of NC_DIMENSION, NC_ATTRIBUTE, or NC_VARIABLE
      is read from files. Add a check against NULL before freeing it. This bug
      only appears when reading files with corrupted NC tags. See r3645.

  o New example programs
    * example/C/vard_mvars.c shows an example of using a single vard API call
      to write or read two variables.

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/testcases/test_fillvalue.c - tests PnetCDF allows to put attribute
      _FillValue for global variable and for non-global variable, requires the
      data type of attribute _FillValue be the same as the variable's.
    * test/F90/test_attr_int64.f90 - tests the bug fixed in r3730 that
      nf90mpi_put_att API writes a scalar attribute of type NF90_INT64 that
      was mistakenly casted to NF90_INT.
    * test/testcase/test_vard_rec.c - tests ncmpi_put_vard APIs for writing a
      record variable with one record at a time. This is to test the fix to
      bug reported by Jim Edwards in r3675.
    * test/nonblocking/large_num_reqs.c - tests large number of nonblocking put
      and get requests (larger than NC_REQUEST_CHUNK, the constant used to grow
      the internal queues that store the nonblocking put and get requests. This
      is to test bug fix in r3651.
    * test/testcases/tst_def_var_fill.c - tests API ncmpi_def_var_fill and
      verifies fill values when fill mode is turned on and off.
    * src/utils/ncvalidator/tst_open.c - tests API ncmpi_open against corrupted
      files and checks expected error codes.

  o Conformity with NetCDF library
    * NetCDF allows to put attribute _FillValue of any NC data type to the
      global variable, NC_GLOBAL. PnetCDF conforms with this behavior.
    * For non-global variables, NetCDF treats the classic and HDF5 files
      differently. For classic files, it allows to create attribute _FillValue
      of a data type that is different from the variable's. For HDF5 files, the
      data type of attribute _FillValue must be the same as the variable.
      PnetCDF requires the data type of attribute _FillValue be the same as
      the variable's.

  o Conflict with NetCDF library
    * none

  o Issues related to MPI library vendors:
    * none

  o Issues related to Darshan library:
    * none

  o Clarifications
    * none
