------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * The configure environment has been migrated to use GNU automake and
      libtool.
    * Building shared libraries is now supported with configure option
      --enable-shared. However, the default configuration is to build static
      library only. Note linking shared libraries is not recommended due to
      the likely performance degradation.

  o New optimization
    * Use hash function for faster attribute name lookup. See r3335.

  o New Limitations
    * PnetCDF now requires the underlying MPI library define data type
      MPI_Offset an 8-byte integer. Configuration process will be aborted if
      MPI_Offset is detected to be of size 4 bytes. See r2944.
    * The maximum number of files that can be simultaneously opened by an MPI
      process is now limited to 1024 (a new constant NC_MAX_NFILES defined in
      pnetcdf.h). When this limit is reached, error code NC_ENFILE will be
      thrown.
    * NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS, the maximum number of dimensions per variable is raised
      to 2147483647, i.e. NC_MAX_INT
    * NC_MAX_DIMS, the maximum number of dimensions per file is raised to
      2147483647, i.e. NC_MAX_INT
    * NC_MAX_ATTRS, the maximum number of attributes per file is raised to
      2147483647, i.e. NC_MAX_INT
    * NC_MAX_VARS, the maximum number of variables per file is raised to
      2147483647, i.e. NC_MAX_INT

  o New constants
    * NC_FORMAT_UNKNOWN, NF_FORMAT_UNKNOWN, and NF90_FORMAT_UNKNOWN are new
      constants that are one of the returned values of argument formatp in the
      API ncmpi_inq_file_format when the file under inquiry is unrecognizable
      by PnetCDF library.
    * NC_MAX_NFILES, NF_MAX_NFILES, and NF90_MAX_NFILES define the maximum
      number of files that can be kept opened by an MPI process.

  o New APIs
    * none

  o API syntax changes
    * Add C type qualifier "const" to argument fill_value of ncmpi_def_var_fill
      to indicate the contents pointed by fill_value is immutable.

  o Semantics updates
    * Calling ncmpi_end_indep_data() in collective data mode is no longer
      considered illegal, starting from this release 1.9.0. In this case, the
      API simply returns NC_NOERR. Note calling ncmpi_begin_indep_data() in
      independent data mode has been allowed since PnetCDF 1.2.0. Thanks to
      Gregory Sjaardema for pointing out the asymmetry between the two APIs.
      See r3517.
    * For CDF-5 files, the maximum size of a variable or a variable's record
      is NC_MAX_INT64-3 (i.e. 2^64-4).
    * When the file create/open modes are not consistent among processes, the
      modes on all processes will be replaced by rank 0's mode and PnetCDF
      library will still try to create/open the file. Error code
      NC_EMULTIDEFINE_CMODE or NC_EMULTIDEFINE_OMODE will be returned on
      processes whose modes disagree with rank 0's. If safe mode is on, then
      all processes will also get the same error code.

  o New error code precedence
    * none

  o Updated error strings
    * The error string corresponding to error code NC_EMAXDIMS is changed to
      cover the case when NC_MAX_DIMS or NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS is exceeded.

  o New error code
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o New build recipe
    * doc/README.Ubuntu provides build instructions for Ubuntu Linux OS.

  o New test program
    * test/testcases/tst_info.c - tests an internal bug in heap memory
      allocation trace mechanism. See r3514.
    * test/cdf_format/tst_corrupt.c
      1. tests whether NC_EMAXDIMS can be thrown when opening a corrupted file
         header with number of dimensions being larger than NC_MAX_DIMS.
      2. tests whether NC_EMAXATTS can be thrown when opening a corrupted file
         header with number of attributes being larger than NC_MAX_ATTRS.
      3. tests whether NC_EBADDIM can be thrown when opening a corrupted file
         header with dimension ID of a variable is beyond the number of
         dimensions defined in the file.
      4. tests whether NC_EBADTYPE can be thrown when opening a corrupted file
         header with nc_type of a variable is not within the legal NC atomic
         data type allowed by the file format.
    * test/testcases/tst_max_var_dims.c - tests the number of dimensions
      against NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS when calling ncmpi_def_var API.
    * test/largefile/tst_cdf5_begin.c - tests CDF-5 file header corruption for
      the case when the starting file offsets of variables are not in an
      increasing order as they defined.
    * test/cdf_format/tst_open_cdf5.c - tests whether NC_ENOTNC can be
      correctly thrown when opening a corrupted CDF-5 (bad_begin.nc5) which
      contains two variables and the second variable's starting file offset is
      less than the first variable's end offset.
    * test/testcases/large_var_cdf5.c - tests whether NC_EVARSIZE can be
      correctly thrown when a variable or a variable record is larger than
      NC_MAX_INT64-3.
    * test/testcases/mix_collectives.c - tests collective get/put APIs that
      allow different processes to call different kinds of APIs (i.e. var1,
      vara, vars, varm, etc.) and use different var IDs. In other words, the
      API kinds can be different among processes in a collective call.
    * test/largefile/high_dim_var.c - tests blocking vars APIs for high-
      dimensional variables. See r3164.
    * test/largefile/large_dims_vars_attrs.c - tests large number of
      dimensions, large number of variables, and large number of attributes.
    * test/testcases/put_all_kinds.m4 - tests various blocking put APIs.
    * test/testcases/tst_dimsizes.c - borrowed from NetCDF library to test
      define/inquire APIs for the maximum allowable dimension sizes. This test
      program is similar to (or a subset of) test/cdf_format/dim_cdf12.c
    * test/testcases/null_args.c - tests whether the correct error codes can
      be returned when using NULL arguments for start, count, stride, or imap

  o Conformity with NetCDF library
    * API ncmpi_open now checks the number of large variables that is legal
      for CDF-1 and CDF-2 files. See r2961. For the information about the
      number of large variables allowed in the classic formats can be found in
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/file_structure_and_performance.html#classic_format_limitations
    * Add checking for error code NC_ELATEFILL. Setting a variable's attribute
      _FillValue must be done in the variable's initial define mode.
    * NetCDF-4 documents in 4.4.1 and prior state that setting attribute
      _FillValue for global variable NC_GLOBAL is not allowed and error code
      NC_EINVAL will be thrown. Revisions r2954, r2955, and r2956 enforce this
      rule. However, because the rule has never been implemented in any NetCDF
      official release, NetCDF developers have decided to abandon this rule
      by revising the NetCDF document starting from v4.5. See discussion in
      NetCDF GitHub pull request 458. To be consistent with NetCDF, PnetCDF
      follows the same decision by wrapping the checking with preprocessor
      conditional #ifdef NO_NC_GLOBAL_FILLVALUE (see r3403). Note NC_EGLOBAL
      will be thrown when using NC_GLOBAL in ncmpi_def_var_fill(). This is
      due to no data type information for the fill value can be passed.
    * From the releases of 1.6.1 through 1.8.1, putting attribute _FillValue
      automatically turns on the fill mode for the variable. Similarly,
      deleting attribute _FillValue turns off the fill mode. However, this
      behavior does not conform with NetCDF library. This release fixes this
      inconsistency, so putting or deleting attribute _FillValue does not
      affect a variable's fill mode. See r2951.

  o Conflict with NetCDF library
    * Null-byte padding for attribute values in file header -- The classic CDF
      specifications require header padding uses null (\x00) bytes. However,
      prior to version 4.5.0, NetCDF did not implement this specification
      entirely. In particular, it has never enforced the null-byte padding for
      attribute values (it has for others, such as names of dimension,
      variables, and attributes.) It also appears that files created by SciPy
      NetCDF module or NetCDF Java module, both developed independent from
      NetCDF-C, also fail to respect this padding specification.  This becomes
      a problem for PnetCDF to read such netCDF files, because PnetCDF enforces
      the header padding from its very first release.  The files violating the
      padding specification will not be readable by PnetCDF of all releases
      prior to 1.9.0 and error code NC_EINVAL or NC_ENOTNC will be thrown when
      opening such files.  Note if the sizes of all attribute values of your
      files are aligned with 4-byte boundaries, then the files are readable by
      PnetCDF.  In order to keep the files in question readable by PnetCDF,
      checking for null-byte padding has been disabled in 1.9.0. But, we keep
      this checking in ncvalidator, a utility program that can report whether a
      CDF file violates the file format specification, including this null-byte
      padding. See r3528 for source codes changed and discussion in NetCDF
      Github issue https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/657.

  o Issues related to MPI library vendors:
    * When using OpenMPI 2.0.0 through the latest 2.1.2 to build PnetCDF 1.8.1
      and prior, the following message may appear when running make check:
          "MPI error (MPI_File_open) : MPI_ERR_FILE: invalid file"
      but the test programs report "pass". This message can be safely ignored.
      It is due to OpenMPI failing to translate system error code ENOENT into
      MPI_ERR_NO_SUCH_FILE, but returns MPI_ERR_FILE instead. Thanks to Edgar
      Gabriel, a trick to silence the messages is to add the following to the
      command line of make check:
        TEST_SEQRUN="/path/to/OpenMPI/2.x.x/bin/mpirun --mca io romio314 -n 1"
      See discussion thread in OpenMPI:
      https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/4412
      Note this error message does not appear in PnetCDF 1.9.0 and after.
    * When using OpenMPI 2.1.1 and priors built with Intel compilers 17.0.0,
      the test program nonblocking/mcoll_testf.f90 fails with segmentation
      fault. This is due to a bug in OpenMPI. See discussion thread in OpenMPI:
      https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/3695
    * PnetCDF can no longer be built on 32-bit machines if using OpenMPI
      versions 2.0.2 and 1.10.6 and earlier versions. This is because OpenMPI
      configures type MPI_Offset as a 4-byte integer on all 32-bit machines,
      even if the machines allow 64-bit file offsets, known as large-file
      support. We suggest to use other MPI libraries to build PnetCDF on 32-bit
      machines. See the discussion thread in OpenMPI:
      https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/3195
    * Fix test/nc_test/test_read.m4 and test/testcases/modes.c which test
      whether the correct error codes can be returned when opening a
      non-existing file. Thanks to Mark Dixon for testing various MPI
      libraries, C compilers, and file systems, we found that when using
      MVAPICH2 2.2, its Lustre driver always adds O_CREAT flag to the open()
      calls. Because of this behavior, the non-existing file will be created
      with zero length, which causes PnetCDF to spew NC_ENOTNC instead of
      NC_ENOENT. A bug report has been filed to MVAPICH. The fix shall come in
      the next release of MVAPICH. The bug report can be found in
      http://mailman.cse.ohio-state.edu/pipermail/mvapich-discuss/2017-February/006300.html

  o Issues related to Darshan library:
    * When using Darshan in conjunction with PnetCDF, if you encounter
      link-time or run-time errors with messages shown below, then we recommend
      to use Darshan library version 3.1.5 and later.

      During compile/link time:
      /soft/perftools/darshan/lib/libdarshan-mpi-io.a(darshan-pnetcdf.o):
      In function `__wrap_ncmpi_create': darshan-pnetcdf.c:62: undefined
      reference to `ncmpi_create'

      During run time:
      WARNING: Darshan ncmpi_create() stub called; this is probably the result
      of a link-time problem.

  o Other updates:
    * Update UTF8 encoding utility to use utf8proc library version 2.1.0 from
      the Julia Language project, https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc
      License https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc/blob/master/LICENSE.md
    * Add quiet mode command-line option "-q" to utility program ncvalidator.
    * Add an internal check for whether the file starting offsets of all
      variables are in an increasing order as the variables defines. See r3369.
    * All build recipes (README files) have been moved to folder doc. Most of
      the recipes have been updated with instructions for building shared
      libraries.
    * Rename configure-time variables TEST_SEQRUN, TEST_MPIRUN, and TEST_OUTDIR
      to TESTSEQRUN, TESTMPIRUN, and TESTOUTDIR, respectively. This change
      avoids conflict to the name convention reserved by automake.
    * Fix TESTMPIRUN default value to use full path specified in --with-mpi at
      configure command line

  o Bug fixes
    * Fix a bug in nonblocking APIs when one request's access region covers
      more than one other non-interleaved requests. PnetCDF fails to identify
      them as a single group of interleaved requests. Test program
      test/nonblocking/interleaved.c has been revised to test the fix.
      See r3389.
    * Fix a bug in string parsing the environment variable PNETCDF_HINTS and
      print warning messages when hint strings are ill-formed. See r3284.
    * Fix a bug in F90 APIs for reading and writing scalar variables, i.e.
      number of dimensions is zero. The bugs appear only when using Intel
      Fortran compiler which does not allow checking presence of an argument
      and its contents in the same if condition. See r3009, r3012, r3013.
    * Conform with CDF-2 file format specification on using 2^32-1 for vsize
      when the variable size is larger than 23^2-4 bytes. See r2957.
    * Fix a bug in nc_test when running on an ARMv7 architecture, a raspberry
      pi, where char is unsigned and which is little Endian, 32-bit machine.
      See r2922.
    * Fix a bug that fails to do byte-swap when retrieving user-defined fill
      values. See r2864. This fix is critical when PnetCDF is configured with
      option erange-fill enabled (default mode) and the target platform is a
      Little Endian.

  o Clarifications
    * The NetCDF CDF formats define a set of external NC data types and
      describe their intents of use, shown below.

      External type  No. Bits  Intent of use
      -------------  --------  ---------------------------------
      NC_CHAR         8        text data (the only non-numerical type in NetCDF)
      NC_BYTE         8        1-byte integer
      NC_SHORT       16        2-byte signed integer
      NC_INT         32        4-byte signed integer
      NC_FLOAT       32        4-byte floating point number
      NC_DOUBLE      64        8-byte real number in double precision
      NC_UBYTE        8        unsigned 1-byte integer
      NC_USHORT      16        unsigned 2-byte integer
      NC_UINT        32        unsigned 4-byte integer
      NC_INT64       64        signed 8-byte integer
      NC_UINT64      64        unsigned 8-byte integer

      Note NC_CHAR is the only non-numerical data type available in NetCDF
      realm.  All other external types are considered numerical, which are
      illegal to be converted (type-casted) to and from a NetCDF variable
      defined in NC_CHAR type (error code NC_ECHAR will be thrown). The only
      legal APIs to read/write a variable of type NC_CHAR are the "_text" APIs.

    * Starting from 1.7.0, PnetCDF translates internal data types (i.e. data
      types of the I/O buffer and also used in the API name such as text,
      schar, uchar, short, int, etc.) to MPI data types based on the table
      below. Note MPI_BYTE does no correspond to any internal data type used
      in NetCDF/PnetCDF APIs. Thus, when MPI_BYTE is used to construct an MPI
      derived data type which is later used as argument buftype in a flexible
      API, the error code NC_EBADTYPE will be thrown (Not a valid data type).

      Data type of                                  Corresponding
      internal I/O buffer   Example API             MPI datatype
      -------------         ----------------------  -----------------
      text                  ncmpi_put_var_text      MPI_CHAR
      schar                 ncmpi_put_var_schar     MPI_SIGNED_CHAR
      uchar                 ncmpi_put_var_uchar     MPI_UNSIGNED_CHAR
      short                 ncmpi_put_var_short     MPI_SHORT
      ushort                ncmpi_put_var_ushort    MPI_UNSIGNED_SHORT
      int                   ncmpi_put_var_int       MPI_INT
      uint                  ncmpi_put_var_uint      MPI_UNSIGNED
      long                  ncmpi_put_var_long      MPI_LONG
      float                 ncmpi_put_var_float     MPI_FLOAT
      double                ncmpi_put_var_double    MPI_DOUBLE
      longlong              ncmpi_put_var_longlong  MPI_LONG_LONG_INT
      ulonglong             ncmpi_put_var_ulonglong MPI_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG

  o New utility program
    * Utility program ncmpivalid has been renamed to ncvalidator. It is now
      running in serial and thus no longer requires an MPI compiler to build.
      This utility program can be used to validate a classic CDF files, report
      the locations that fail to comply with CDF formats, and repair a file
      whose header fails to use null bytes for paddings, when the command-line
      option "-x" is used.

  o New example programs
    * none

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none
