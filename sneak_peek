This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * none

  o New optimization
    * none

  o New Limitations
    * none

  o Update configure options
    * Option in-place byte-swap is expanded into the followings.
      --enable-in-place-swap : perform byte swap on user I/O buffers whenever
      possible. This option results in the least amount of internal memory
      usage. However, if an immutable user buffer is used, segmentation fault
      may occur when byte swap is performed on user buffer in place.
      --disable-in-place-swap : when byte swap is required, an internal memory
      space will be allocated for byte swap without altering the contents of
      user buffer. This option will increase internal memory footprint.
      default (neither the above option is used at the command line): an
      internal buffer is allocated for byte swap only when the I/O request size
      is less than 4 KiB. For larger requests, user buffers are used for
      in-place byte swap.
      Note -in-place-swap option only affect applications running on Little
      Endian machines, as no byte swap is necessary on Big Endian machines.

  o New constants
    * none

  o New APIs
    * none

  o API syntax changes
    * none

  o API semantics updates
    * ncmpi_put_vard and ncmpi_get_vard APIs
      1. Now allow to write and read two or more consecutive variables in a
         single API call. In this case, argument varid will be the ID of first
         variable. Argument filetype should be constructed by using the
         relative distance between any two consecutive variables. See example
         program examples/C/vard_mvars.c.
      2. When argument filetype is MPI_DATATYPE_NULL, the request is considered
         a zero-length request.

  o New error code precedence
    * none

  o Updated error strings
    * none

  o New error code
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o New build recipe
    * none

  o New/updated utility program
    * ncvalidator adds a new option -t to turn on tracing mode which prints all
      successfully validated metadata till the first error encountered.
    * ncvalidator adds a check to detect whether there are two or more
      unlimited dimensions defined in the file and, if yes, reports error code
      NC_EUNLIMIT.

  o Other updates:
    * Add a check for NC_EUNLIMIT in API ncmpi_open to detect whether two or
      more unlimited dimensions are defined in a corrupted file.

  o Bug fixes
    * Fix the calculation of new record number in put_vard API. Thanks to
      Jim Edwards. See r3675.
    * Fix the calculation of growing size of nonblocking request queues to
      include the number of records of a record variable, as such request is
      split into multiple additional requests, one for each record. See r3651.
    * Remove freeing name object because NC_ENULLPAD is not a fatal error. See
      r3644. This bug only appears when --enable-null-byte-header-padding is
      set at configure time and opening files whose headers are not padded with
      null bytes.
    * Member "value" of NC_dimarray, NC_attrarray, and NC_vararray can still be
      NULL when a corrupted tag of NC_DIMENSION, NC_ATTRIBUTE, or NC_VARIABLE
      is read from files. Add a check against NULL before freeing it. This bug
      only appears when reading files with corrupted NC tags. See r3645.

  o New example programs
    * example/C/vard_mvars.c shows an example of using a single vard API call
      to write or read two consecutive variables.

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/testcase/test_vard_rec.c - tests ncmpi_put_vard APIs for writing a
      record variable with one record at a time. This is to test the fix to
      bug reported by Jim Edwards in r3675.
    * test/nonblocking/large_num_reqs.c - tests large number of nonblocking put
      and get requests (larger than NC_REQUEST_CHUNK, the constant used to grow
      the internal queues that store the nonblocking put and get requests. This
      is to test bug fix in r3651.
    * test/testcases/tst_def_var_fill.c - tests API ncmpi_def_var_fill and
      verifies fill values when fill mode is turned on and off.
    * src/utils/ncvalidator/tst_open.c - tests API ncmpi_open against corrupted
      files and checks expected error codes.
