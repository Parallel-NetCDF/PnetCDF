------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * NetCDF4 format classic mode support via netcdf. 
    * Thread-safe capability is added to this release. It can be enabled with
      configure option --enable-thread-safe. In addition, option --with-pthread
      can be used to specify the path to the pthreads library. This feature
      currently only supports one-thread-per-file I/O operation.

  o New optimization
    * The internal data buffering mechanism in the burst buffer driver is
      removed. This mechanism caches the request data in memory until the
      accumulated size is more than 8 MiB, so the write requests to burst
      buffers can be aligned with 8 MiB boundaries. However, experiments on
      Cray DataWarp show a negligible performance improvement unless the I/O
      request is small and fragment. On the other hand, it can degrade
      performance for mid- and large-sized requests. The burst buffer driver
      now writes directly to the burst buffers for each user write request.

  o New Limitations
    * none

  o Update configure options
    * Enable netcdf4 support.
      --enable-netcdf4 : enable NetCDF4 format classic mode support
      --with-hdf5=<HDF5 install path> : set HDF5 install path
      --with-netcdf=<NetCDF install path> : set NetCDF install path

  o New constants
    * none

  o New APIs
    * none

  o API syntax changes
    * none

  o API semantics updates
    * none
  o New error code precedence
    * none

  o Updated error strings
    * none

  o New error code
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o Build recipes
    * doc/README.NetrCDF4 is added to describe the usage of the new
      feature of NetCDF 4 support.

  o New/updated utility program
    * none

  o Other updates:
    * none

  o Bug fixes
    * none

  o New example programs
    * examples/C/pthread.c - demonstrates the one-file-per-thread I/O example.
      When running on some parallel machines, users may need to set certain
      environment variable to enable MPI multi-threading support, for example
      on Cori @NERSC with command "export MPICH_MAX_THREAD_SAFETY=multiple".

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/nc4/put_get_all_kinds.m4 - test all supported variable read/write API. Make sure they are properly wired up
    * test/nc4/interoperability_rd.m4 - test whether NetCDF4 file written using NetCDF can be read by PnetCDF
    * test/nc4/interoperability_wr.m4 - test whether NetCDF4 file written using PnetCDF can be read by NetCDF
    * test/nc4/simple_xy.c - test reading the simple_xy example somes with NetCDF
    * test/testcases/tst_pthread.c - tests thread-safe capability for scenario
      of each thread operating on a unique file.
      
  o Conformity with NetCDF library
    * NetCDF allow data operation in define mode and vice-versa in NetCDF4 format. PnetCDF does not.

  o Conflict with NetCDF library
    * none

  o Issues related to MPI library vendors:
    * none

  o Issues related to Darshan library:
    * none

  o Clarifications
    * none
