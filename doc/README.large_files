File Support".


==== BACKGROUND

The "traditional" netcdf file format (CDF-1) uses a 4-byte value to hold the
offset into the file where one can find a variable's data

Recently (October 2003), Greg Sjaardema <gdsjaar@sandia.gov> proposed a new
file format (CDF-2) which uses an 8-byte value for the offset.  We use his
approach in parallel netcdf, though we have modified his patch against
netcdf-3.5-beta1 to apply to our codebase.  

I couldn't find a URL to Greg's original message, but here's Russ Rew's
followup: 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/coohl/mhonarc/MailArchives/netcdf/msg04811.html

This means there are two different but compatible implementations of the CDF-2
file format.  We (the Parallel Netcdf developers) will make our best effort to
keep our implementation compatible with the serial netcdf implementation.
Please report any incompatibilities to the developers at
parallel-netcdf@mcs.anl.gov. 

==== PRELIMINARIES

First, it is important that your MPI-IO implementation uses an 8 byte type to
represent the 'MPI_Offset'. Starting from 1.9.0, PnetCDF requires the
underneath MPI library's MPI_Offset to be of 8-byte size.

Second, your platform should use an 8 byte type to represent the 'off_t' type.
On Linux, solaris, IRIX64 (and quite possibly others), parallel-netcdf will
automatically add the right options to the compiler to make this happen.   

Run configure as you normally would.  Let the developers know if configure says
your 'off_t' is 4 bytes.  Proceed to compile and install the library.

==== USAGE

By default, parallel-netcdf will create CDF-1 formatted files.  This
will ensure that datasets created by our library will be compatible with
the large body of applications which expect NetCDF files to be CDF-1
formatted.

To write a CDF-2 formatted file, add the flag 'NC_64BIT_OFFSET' to the
ncmpi_create() function call ( or nfmpi_create() if using the Fortran
interface)

The parallel-netcdf library will detect the format of the dataset.
There are no special options needed to read back files created with the
NC_64BIT_OFFSET flag set.
