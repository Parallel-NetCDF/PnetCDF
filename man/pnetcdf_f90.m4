Returns a string identifying the version of the PnetCDF library, and
when it was built, like: "PNETCDF_VERSION of PNETCDF_RELEASE_DATE2".
.LP
The RCS \fBident(1)\fP command will find a string like
"$\|Id: @\|(#) PnetCDF library version
PNETCDF_VERSION of PNETCDF_RELEASE_DATE2 $"

.SH "ROUTINE DESCRIPTIONS"
.LP
All PnetCDF functions (except
\fBnf90mpi_inq_libvers(\|)\fR and \fBnf90mpi_strerror(\|)\fR) return an integer
status.
This behavior replaces the \fBrcode\fR argument
used in previous versions of the library.
If this returned status value is not equal to
\fBnf90_noerr\fR (zero), it
indicates that an error occurred. The possible status values are defined in
the module \fBpnetcdf\fP.

.sp
Creates a new netCDF dataset at \fIpath\fP collectively by a group of MPI
processes specified by \fIcomm\fP, returning a netCDF ID in \fIncid\fP.  The
argument \fIcmode\fP may include the bitwise-or of the following flags:
\fBnf90_noclobber\fR to protect existing datasets (default is \fBnf90_clobber\fR,
silently blows them away), \fBnf90_share\fR for stronger metadata data consistency
control, \fBnf90_64bit_offset\fR to create a file in the 64-bit offset format
(CDF-2), as opposed to classic format, the default, or \fBnf90_64bit_data\fR to
create a file in the 64-bit data format (CDF-5).
Use either \fBnf90_64bit_offset\fR or \fBnf90_64bit_data\fR.
The 64-bit offset format allows the creation of very large files with far fewer
restrictions than netCDF classic format, but can only be read by the netCDF
library version 3.6 or greater. Users are cautioned that files that use the
64-bit offset format will not be recognized by netCDF applications linked to an
earlier version of the netCDF library than 3.6.  Applications linked to version
3.6 or later will be able to transparently access either the classic format or
64-bit offset format.
The 64-bit data format allows the creation of very large array variables.
CDF-5 files currently will not be recognized by netCDF 3 or 4 library.
.

The argument \fIcmode\fP must be consistent among all MPI processes that
collectively create the file.  The argument \fIinfo\fP is an MPI info object.
Users can use it to supply the file access hints further performance
improvement.  The hints include existing MPI-IO hints as well as hints defined
and used in PnetCDF.

This function is useful in generic applications that
need to get the names of all the attributes associated with a variable
because attributes are accessed by name rather than number in all other
attribute functions (the number of an attribute is more volatile than
the name because it can change when other attributes of the same variable
are deleted).  The attributes for each variable are numbered

\fBnf90mpi_open(\|)\fR or \fBnf90mpi_create(\|)\fR
.TP
character(len=*) \fIname\fP
is the name of a dimension, variable, or attribute.
It shall begin with an alphabetic character, followed by
zero or more alphanumeric characters including the underscore
(`_') or hyphen (`-').  Case is significant.
The maximum allowable number of characters
is \fBnf90_max_name\fR.
Names that begin with an underscore (`_') are reserved for use

These are used to specify 8-bit integers,
characters, 16-bit integers, 32-bit integers, 32-bit IEEE floating point
numbers, and 64-bit IEEE floating-point numbers, respectively.

.TP
integer \fIdimids\fP
is a vector of dimension ID's and defines the shape of a netCDF variable.
The size of the vector shall be greater than or equal to the
rank (i.e. the number of dimensions) of the variable (\fIndims\fP).
The vector shall be ordered by the speed with which a dimension varies:
\fIdimids\fP(\|1) shall be the dimension ID of the most rapidly
varying dimension and
\fIdimids\fP(\fIndims\fP)
shall be the dimension ID of the most slowly
varying dimension.
The maximum possible number of
dimensions for a variable is given by the symbolic constant
\fBnf90_max_var_dims\fR.
.TP
integer \fIdimid\fP
is the ID of a netCDF dimension.
netCDF dimension ID's are allocated sequentially from the
positive
integers beginning with 1.
.TP
integer \fIndims\fP
is either the total number of dimensions in a netCDF dataset or the rank
(i.e. the number of dimensions) of a netCDF variable.
The value shall not be negative or greater than the symbolic constant
\fBnf90_max_var_dims\fR.
.TP
integer \fIvarid\fP
is the ID of a netCDF variable or (for the attribute-access functions)
the symbolic constant
\fBnf90_global\fR,
which is used to reference global attributes.
netCDF variable ID's are allocated sequentially from the
positive
integers beginning with 1.
.TP
integer \fInatts\fP
is the number of global attributes in a netCDF dataset  for the
\fBnf90mpi_inquire(\|)\fR
function or the number
of attributes associated with a netCDF variable for the
\fBnf90mpi_varinq(\|)\fR
function.
.TP
integer(kind=MPI_OFFSET) \fIstart\fP
specifies the starting point
for accessing a netCDF variable's data values
in terms of the indicial coordinates of
the corner of the array section.
The indices start at 1;
thus, the first data
value of a variable is (1, 1, ..., 1).
The size of the vector shall be at least the rank of the associated
netCDF variable and its elements shall correspond, in order, to the
variable's dimensions.
.TP
integer(kind=MPI_OFFSET) \fIstride\fP
specifies the sampling interval along each dimension of the netCDF
variable.   The elements of the stride vector correspond, in order,
to the netCDF variable's dimensions (\fIstride\fP(1))
gives the sampling interval along the most rapidly
varying dimension of the netCDF variable).  Sampling intervals are
specified in type-independent units of elements (a value of 1 selects
consecutive elements of the netCDF variable along the corresponding
dimension, a value of 2 selects every other element, etc.).

.TP
integer(kind=MPI_OFFSET) \fIimap\fP
specifies the mapping between the dimensions of a netCDF variable and
the in-memory structure of the internal data array.  The elements of
the index mapping vector correspond, in order, to the netCDF variable's
dimensions (\fIimap\fP gives the distance
between elements of the internal array corresponding to the most
rapidly varying dimension of the netCDF variable).
Distances between elements are specified in type-independent units of
elements (the distance between internal elements that occupy adjacent
memory locations is 1 and not the element's byte-length as in netCDF 2).

.SH "VARIABLE PREFILLING"
.LP
Prior to version 1.6.1, PnetCDF does not support data filling.
The default fill mode in PnetCDF is \fBNF90_NOFILL\fR.
This contrary to netCDF library whose default is \fBNF90_FILL\fR.
When fill mode is enabled, PnetCDF sets the values of
all newly-defined variables of finite length (i.e. those that do not have
an unlimited, dimension) to the type-dependent fill-value associated with each
variable.  This is done when \fBnf90mpi_enddef(\|)\fR
is called.  The
fill-value for a variable may be changed from the default value by
defining the attribute `\fB_FillValue\fR' for the variable.  This
attribute must have the same type as the variable and be of length one.
.LP
Variables with an unlimited dimension are not prefilled in PnetCDF.
This is also contrary to netCDF, which does prefill record variables.
In PnetCDF, filling a record variable must be done by calling
\fBnf90mpi_fill_var_rec(\|)\fR. Note this fills only one record of
a variable.
.LP
The fill mode for the entire file can be set by \fBnf90mpi_set_fill(\|)\fR.
Per-variable fill mode setting is also available through
\fBnf90mpi_def_var_fill(\|)\fR.
In PnetCDF, changing fill mode must be done in define mode.
In netCDF, it is true only for fix-sized variables.
For record variables, changing fill mode can be made at any time in netCDF.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

.B PNETCDF_SAFE_MODE
Set to 1 to enable metadata consistency check. Warning messages will
