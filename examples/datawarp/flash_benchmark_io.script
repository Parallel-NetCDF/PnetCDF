# Here we provide a job script example to run the built in FLASH benchmark on Cori at NERSC

# The first step is to request burst buffer access from the scheduler
# Add #DW jobdw argument to request burst buffer space.
# We request a private mode burst buffer access with capacity of 1289 GiB from the sm_pool

# The second step is to set up the hint for DataWarp driver. We use following hints:
# Enable the DataWarp driver
#   nc_dw=enable;
# DataWarp will recycle the space after job execution. We don't need to delete the log files.
#   nc_dw_del_on_close=disable;
# We are using private mode, DW_JOB_PRIVATE will be set to the path of burst buffer
#   nc_dw_dirname=${DW_JOB_PRIVATE}
# We can set the optional nc_dw_flush_buffer_size hint to limit the memory space PnetCDF can use on flushing the log.
# There is no need to do so since the built in FLASH benchmark by default only generate around 75 MiB of data per process

# The DataWarp driver is designed to be as transparent as possible.
# In most cases, we can run the job as usual after previous 2 steps.
# We don't need to modify FLASH benchmark in this case.
